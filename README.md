#**DiscGolfEventine website - basic information**

**Introduction**

Hi everyone!

This is the final project of an almost 1 year Java programming course organized by Software Development Academy.
The course took place from February 2021 until December 2021. 
Below we present the most important information about our Eventine website.

**Developers:** _(JavaRemoteCZ1 group)_

- Michal Kober

- Alena Divíšková

- Natália Kovarovičová


**Application Guidelines**

We created an application for posting and maintaining private events for disc golf fans.

User is able to create an account and login to the website:

Once a user is signed in, he can create or edit his own event.

Users are able to apply to all available events on the home page and also commenting on events by logged in users.
